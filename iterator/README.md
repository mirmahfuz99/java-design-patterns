What is Iterator:

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern. The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

The iterator design pattern consists of several components like
Iterator, ConcreateIterator, Aggregate and ConcreateAggregate.

Applicability:
To access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal representation.
To support multiple traversals of aggregate objects.
To provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures.
